# Echoes of Aetherium â€“ Skill Test Submission  
**Submitted by: Vaibhav Kolhe**  

## Overview  
For this skill test, I thoroughly analyzed the provided card memory game codebase before approaching the implementation. Although I had several ideas to enhance the game's logic, I kept UI changes minimal to respect the existing design structure. I've implemented all the required tasks for both the **Web3 Developer** and **Blockchain Developer** roles, detailed below.

## Web3 Developer Tasks

### âœ… Task 1 â€“ Implement MetaMask Wallet Connection  
To handle wallet connectivity, I created a reusable `connectWallet.js` utility that integrates MetaMask using `ethers.js`.  
Additionally, I created a `context` folder with a global context provider (`WalletContext.js`) to ensure that the `userAddress` and `contractInstance` are available throughout the app without reinitializing the contract repeatedly.

**Highlights:**  
- Uses React Context API for global state management.
- Efficient and modular wallet connection logic.

### âœ… Task 2 â€“ Display Connected Wallet Address  
Once the wallet is connected:
- A dialog appears confirming the connected wallet address.
- On the login page, a message displays the active address at the top for user clarity.

## Blockchain Developer Tasks

### âœ… Task 1 â€“ Solidity Smart Contract for Game Logic  
I implemented a smart contract that tracks gameplay data on-chain. It includes:
- Player initialization with 100 in-game coins.
- +10 coins on a correct match, -2 coins on a wrong attempt.
- Storage of player statistics such as level, matched pairs, and time.

The contract sets the foundation for future features like a global scoreboard. Though I didnâ€™t implement the scoreboard UI due to constraints, the data is already being recorded and could be easily extended.

**Possible Improvements:**  
- Upgrade to ERC20 tokens for coin mechanics.
- On-chain leaderboard integration using stored player data.

### âœ… Task 2 â€“ Deploy Locally Using Hardhat and Integrate with Frontend  
Steps followed:
1. Initialized a Hardhat project and created `GameLogic.sol`.
2. Wrote scripts for deployment (`deploy.js`) and interaction (`getPlayerData.js`).
3. Configured `hardhat.config.js` for the local node.
4. Compiled contracts to generate the ABI and artifacts.
5. Deployed the contract while running `npx hardhat node`.
6. Interacted with the contract on the frontend.
7. Also tested the contract deployment and interaction on the Sepolia testnet.

## Final Notes  
I truly enjoyed working on this project and tried to give my best to meet your expectations. While working within the provided structure, I ensured solid integration between the frontend and blockchain layers. Iâ€™m excited about the possibility of contributing to the Echoes of Aetherium team and hope this project demonstrates both my passion and capabilities.

Thank you for the opportunity!
